## **1. Motivation**

Our team chose to develop a Personal Finance Tracker because managing daily finances is a relatable challenge for many people. Students, professionals, and families all need to track income, expenses, and savings, but existing tools are mostly limited by paywalls, dependent on mobile apps, or overloaded with features that make them complex to use. Our team wants to create a utility that is simple, accessible, and efficient, which is a lightweight command-line finance tracker that anyone can use directly from their terminal.

Our team found this project idea motivating because it combines both personal need for practical usefulness and the opportunity to expand the Rust ecosystem for technical creativity. What excites us most is that this project is practical and fun. It solves real-world problems we face, like logging recurring expenses, understanding where our money goes each month, converting between currencies when travelling around different countries, and managing accounts across different banks. It is also a challenge for us to explore advanced Rust libraries for databases, APIs, and text-based interfaces. This will make the development process rewarding and educational.

From a community perspective, there is a considerable gap in the Rust ecosystem that, although Rust has excellent support for systems programming and web services, there is a lack of finance-focused command-line tools. Most available utilities are written in Python, Java, or C++. By implementing this project in Rust, our team will gain valuable experience with the Rust ecosystem. Nevertheless, this project will contribute a utility that may inspire future Rust developers to explore beyond traditional systems programming.

Generally, the motivation behind our project comes from three main drivers:
- **Practical need** — addressing a real-world problem in personal finance management.
- **Personal satisfaction** — working on a project that is both fun and directly applicable to people’s lives satisfied our team a lot.
- **Community contribution** — filling a gap in Rust’s ecosystem that potentially inspires future applications. 



## **2. Project Objectives and Key Features**

### **2.1 Objectives**
The Object of the Personal Tracker is to use **Rust’s guarantees of memory safety**, **strict type system**, and **efficient concurrency** to perform a **Complete, user-friendly, terminal-based financial utility**.  

Our goal is to develop a **practical and user-friendly command-line personal finance tracker** that enables users to manage their daily finances across multiple currencies and bank accounts. The tool enables users to log transactions, categorize them, and view their spending patterns over time.  

By using a backend server for data storage and integrating real-time exchange rate APIs, we aim to create a system that's both accessible and secure, while providing accurate financial insights regardless of which currencies users work with.  

In addition to being a practical tool for everyday use, we aim to explore and demonstrate how **Rust** can be applied to real-world financial records, competing with **JavaScript** and **Python** for mature personal finance ecosystems.


### **2.2 Key Features**

To realize this objective, the following components will be developed:

---

#### **Ping Wang is responsible for:**

#### **2.2.1 Transaction Logging and Multi-Account Support**

Our personal finance tracker allows users to register both expenses and income entries, assigning them to user-defined categories. Supporting complex entries where a single transaction is distributed into multiple categories (e.g., groceries split into food, cleaning supplies, and entertainment).  

The utility manages different account types, such as savings, checking, and credit cards. We aim to model realistic financial scenarios where one personal account may encompass several cards or sub-accounts across banks.

---

#### **2.2.2 Multi-Currency Support with Real-Time Exchange Rates**

Many people deal with multiple currencies, whether from travel, daily online purchases. Our personal finance tracker supports multiple bank accounts in different currencies and can fetch real-time exchange rates via API or customize the exchange rate manually.  

This means the currency conversion functionality automatically retrieves current exchange rates to provide accurate conversions. Users can also view their complete financial picture across all accounts without calculating conversions between currencies manually.  

Users could manage different account types, such as savings, checking, and credit cards, in our all-in-one utility, where one personal account may encompass several cards or sub-accounts across banks.

#### **Ziang Wang is responsible for:**

#### **2.2.3 Recurring Transactions**

Expenses and income sometimes follow predictable patterns. Users can set up recurring expenses such as rent, salary, or subscriptions. When creating a recurring transaction, users specify the amount, category, frequency (monthly most of the time), and start date.  

Our finance tracker will also automatically create these transactions at the appropriate intervals.

**This feature provides two practical benefits:**

- **Reduced manual entry:** Once set up, recurring transactions are logged automatically, saving time and reducing the chance of forgetting to record regular expenses or income.  
- **Better financial planning:** Users can view their scheduled recurring transactions to understand expected cash flow. This helps with anticipating upcoming expenses and planning spending accordingly.  

Users maintain full control over recurring transactions—they can modify amounts, pause, or cancel them as needed when circumstances change. This flexibility ensures the tool adapts to real-life situations like salary increases, subscription cancellations, or rent adjustments.

---

#### **2.2.4 Expense Analysis and Insights**

Our finance tracker will provide simple, text-based summaries and charts to help users understand their spending patterns.  

Users can query their transaction data to generate various reports and insights:

- **Spending comparisons:** See how spending in specific categories has changed over time (e.g., "This month you spent 35% more on groceries compared to last month")  
- **Category breakdowns:** View top spending categories for a given period (e.g., "Your top three spending categories are: Food, Transportation, Entertainment")  
- **Custom queries:** Users can filter transactions by date range, category, account, or amount to analyze specific aspects of their finances  

These insights are presented in a straightforward, text-based format that focuses on clarity. The goal is to surface useful information that helps users identify trends and make informed decisions about their spending habits.

---

#### **Muchen Liu is responsible for:**

#### **2.2.5 Data Export (CSV/JSON)**

Users can export their transaction data in standard CSV or JSON formats, which supports other use cases:

- **Tax preparation:** Export annual transaction data to share with accountants or import into tax software  
- **External analysis:** Open exported CSV files in spreadsheet applications like Excel or Google Sheets for custom charts, pivot tables, or detailed analysis  
- **Data portability:** Keep backup copies of financial records or migrate data to other financial management tools  

The export function allows users to specify date ranges and select which accounts or categories to include, so they can export exactly the data they need rather than everything at once. Both CSV and JSON formats are supported here.

---

#### **2.2.6 Text-Based Interface**

Build an intuitive command-line interface using **ratatui**. Include tables, graphs, and interactive forms, making the experience accessible to users who prefer terminal workflows.

---

### **Alignment with Rust Ecosystem Gap**

This project directly addresses the lack of a comprehensive personal finance tracker in the Rust ecosystem.  

By incorporating reliable storage, expressive TUI components, and back-end integration with frameworks such as **Axum** or **Actix Web** and **Diesel/SQLx**, this work demonstrates how Rust can support practical domain-specific applications.
